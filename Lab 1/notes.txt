gaussian vs mixed-gaussian


tissue probability map can be obtained from spm tool + tissue segmentation task
obtain the brain mask to do skull strip
use t1 for anatomical seg
upload it in spm and do segmentation

bias correction -> click to obtain bias field, image corrected, and obtain the tissues segmented


1. Segment the 3 c

itksnap of the tisue prob ma for the 3 tissues of the , prob of each voxel that belons to each of the 3 clusters

bias corrected image: t1 with the bias correction done -> Obtained directly at the same time when segmenting
MRI without the skull -> skull stripping, t1 and t2 without the bones --- use the tissue masks 


the probability map is the final segmentation

WM, GM, CSF, soft tissue, skull

c1 gray
c2 white
c3 csf
c4 bone
c5 soft tissue

mt1 is the bias corrected

ImgCalc is used to obtain the union of the 3 clusters 


1. Segment and obtain the corrected bias field and the tissue masks

nibabel

((c1xm1) + c2xm1) + c3xm3)
((i2.*i1) + (i3.*i1)) + (

i1= mt1
i2= c1t1
i3= c2t1
i4= c3t1

m1x(c1+c2+c3)>0.2


i1.*((i2+i3+i4)) > 0.2 this includes 3 tissues 


compare the label or each tissue with each segmented volume c1:c3
